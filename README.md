some wee little javascript experiments

algorithms: practice implementing sorting algorithms in javascript 

commentParser: an attempt to obtain just the content of a Dreamwidth comment thread - WIP  

imageReplacer: a script to find photos that reference "election" or "trump" and replaces them with pictures of corgi puppies. 

lyricsCheater: a bit of javascript that will try out an array of common words in a lyrics quiz on Sporcle.com, so you can move on to things that will actually help identify the song.
