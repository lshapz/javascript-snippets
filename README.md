snippets of javascript what I wrote

spork.js - a bit of javascript that will try out an array of common words in a lyrics quiz on Sporcle.com, so you can move on to things that will actually help identify the song. 

corgi.js - a script to find photos that reference "election" or "trump" and replaces them with pictures of corgi puppies.
